# project-7

This is a express based app to showcase the projects I have made so far.

all the pug files are found in the views folder.

the main file that stores all the project info and profile info is stored in the myInfo.json file in the data folder

CSS files, images, and js for the html are found in the public folder. As well as the example html that the pug files are based off of.

the express routes are handled by the index.js and project.js files found in the routes folder

to run the project just use... node app.js

all the dependencies are in the package.json file. just run npm install to download them before running the project.
